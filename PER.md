# PHP Evolving Recommendations

A PHP Evolving Recommendations is a meta document accompanied by one or more artifacts that are set to evolve over time with multiple releases.
Following the [PER Workflow Bylaw][workflow], when a PER has passed the Entrance Vote it will be listed here as "In Development"; once the first release of an artifact is tagged, it will be listed as "Released".

As also described in the [Mission and Structure Bylaw][structure], the Editor of a working group working on a PER is essentially the lead contributor and writer, and they are supported by at least two voting members; the Sponsor is instead a Project Representative or Core Committee member that acts as a steward and helps pushing the proposal forward.
